# schoolbag-organizer
A ridiculously simple software that tells you what you have to add and remove from you schoolbag for each of your classes basically.

It tells you what you have to swap from schoolbag for the current day if you launch it before 2PM.
After 2PM, it will do the same for the following day. When lauched on Fridays after 2PM, it will skip to Mondays.

This is the only C# program I wrote, back in 2011 (I was in "Quatri√®me", the French equivalent of 8th grade) because i thought that checking my class schedule everyday was a time consuming pain in the ass. In the end, pretty much everybody ended up using it in my class.

My old class schedule is still in the source code, but you can of course modify the code to put yours instead.

It's on my github as a souvenir, but I will eventually rewrite this entirely to make it more convinient.
